A portfolio should sound like you, not like the last template you downloaded.
At Voix, the goal is simple: shape the story first, then design the site
around it.

<!-- truncate -->

When your voice is clear, clients understand what you do, why it matters, and
how to work with you. That clarity is the difference between a skim and a
reply.

We start with a one-line promise, build a short narrative around it, and use
case studies to prove it. Design supports the story, not the other way around.
