Voix sites are built on an open-source stack, which means you never pay
software license fees to keep your portfolio live.

<!-- truncate -->

Here is what that means in practice:

- No monthly per-seat fees
- No paywalled publishing tools
- No surprise charges when your site grows

You pay for the build once, then an annual care plan if you want ongoing
updates. Hosting on GitHub Pages is free, and custom domains are billed at
cost.

This structure keeps your portfolio lean, predictable, and fully in your
control.
