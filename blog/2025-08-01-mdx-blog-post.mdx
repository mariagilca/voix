Great case studies are short and structured. We use six beats so every project
reads quickly and still feels human.

:::tip Quick rule
If a reader cannot summarize the project in 20 seconds, it is too long.

## The six beats

1. The context
2. The challenge
3. Your approach
4. The craft or tools
5. The outcome
6. The takeaway

Keep each beat to 1-3 sentences. Add one metric or quote if you have it.
