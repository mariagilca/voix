Start building your portfolio \u2192\\n\\nA resume lists what you did. A portfolio shows what you can do.\\n\\nFor casting directors and agents, your portfolio is the only thing that matters before you enter the room. It proves your range. It validates your talent.\\n\\nThis guide explains how to build a portfolio that works as hard as you do. You will learn to capture attention, define your brand, and own your online presence without paying monthly rent on your website.\\n\\nWhether you are a student or a working professional, this is how you set yourself apart.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## The essentials\\n\\n1. Gather your materials. Get professional headshots, a clean resume, and a sharp showreel.\\n2. Write a clear bio. State your training and your type. Be honest.\\n3. Build on solid ground. Use open-source tools like Voix. Pay once. Own the code.\\n4. Add social proof. Display reviews, awards, and press.\\n5. Stay current. Update your look and your credits regularly.\\n\\n## How to build your portfolio in 5 steps\\n\\nYour portfolio must be professional and personal. Follow these steps to build a site that tells the truth about your ability.\\n\\n### 1. Select your materials\\n\\nStart with the basics. Do not clutter the page. You need four things:\\n\\n- Headshots: Pick two or three images. One commercial (warm), one theatrical (serious), one neutral. Use good lighting. High resolution is mandatory.\\n- Resume: List your contact info, union status, training, and credits. Keep it detailed. If you have special skills (combat, dance, accents), list them here.\\n- Showreel: You have sixty seconds to impress a director. Keep your reel under two minutes. Put your best acting in the first ten seconds.\\n- Contact info: Make it easy to find you.\\n\\n### 2. Write an honest bio\\n\\nYour bio defines you. It is your introduction. Keep it to two paragraphs.\\n\\nCasting directors want to know the person behind the character. Mention your background, your training, and what drives you. If you studied at a specific conservatory or have a niche skill, write it down.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n> \\"I am a Chicago-based actor focused on gritty, realistic drama. I trained at The Second City and have appeared in independent features and regional theater. I bring intensity and focus to the work.\\"\\n\\n### 3. Design and own your platform\\n\\nMost portfolio builders rent you space. They charge you every month to keep your site alive.\\n\\nDon\'t rent. Own.\\n\\nUse an open-source builder like Voix. You pay a single fee for the build. The code belongs to you. The only recurring cost is the domain name (the .com), which you pay directly to the registrar.\\n\\nYour site needs these pages:\\n\\n- Home/About: Your face and your bio.\\n- Media: Your showreel and voice clips.\\n- Gallery: Production stills and headshots.\\n- Resume: A viewable list and a downloadable PDF.\\n- Contact: Representation info and a direct email.\\n\\nDesign tip: Keep it clean. Use white space. Use black text. Do not use flashy animations. Let your acting be the loudest thing on the page.\\n\\n### 4. Prove your value\\n\\nAnyone can call themselves an actor. Prove it.\\n\\nAdd a section for press and achievements. This is social proof. It tells a director that others have hired you and liked the result.\\n\\n- Awards: Display logos or certificates.\\n- Reviews: Quote the best lines from reputable sources.\\n- Testimonials: Ask directors or coaches for a sentence about your work ethic.\\n\\nIf you are working on something now, list it. An active actor is a hireable actor.\\n\\n### 5. Keep it fresh\\n\\nA stale portfolio hurts your career.\\n\\nUpdate your headshots when you change your hair or age. Update your reel when you get better footage. If a credit on your resume is five years old and amateur, cut it.\\n\\nYour portfolio is a living document. Treat it that way.\\n\\n## Frequently asked questions\\n\\nHow long should my reel be? One to two minutes. Quality beats quantity. If the audio is bad, cut it.\\n\\nDo I need a printed portfolio? Yes. Digital gets you the audition. Print is for the room. Bring a headshot and resume stapled together.\\n\\nHow often should I update? Every six months. Or immediately after you finish a major project."},{"id":"maintenance-that-works","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/maintenance-that-works","source":"@site/blog/2025-08-26-welcome/index.md","title":"Maintenance that keeps your voice current","description":"A portfolio should not drift out of date.
