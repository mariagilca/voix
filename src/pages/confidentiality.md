## Confidentiality policy

"Confidential Information" includes all non-public materials, access
credentials, and business details shared with us. We use it only to deliver the
services, restrict access to collaborators who need it, and protect it with
reasonable technical and organizational safeguards. We do not publish your work
or name without your written consent. We retain a copy of the initial delivered
project for one year, after which the project is maintained on the client's Git
account or similar hosting. Upon request, we return or delete confidential
materials, except where retention is required by law.
