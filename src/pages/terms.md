## Terms and conditions

Services are provided under a written proposal or statement of work that
defines scope, timeline, and fees. Client materials must be provided on time to
meet delivery dates; out-of-scope requests require written approval. A 50%
deposit is due at contract signing, with the remaining 50% due upon delivery;
standard delivery is within two business weeks from receipt of the deposit and
required materials. Late payments incur a 5% daily fee. One person can add up to
five portfolio materials with our help or independently using the instructions
we provide; additional additions are treated as new scope. Any bugs we
introduce are fixed at no charge. If a defect is caused by client changes, we
will propose a fix priced case by case, capped at 500 EUR. Fees, payment
schedule, and invoicing terms are stated in the proposal, and work begins after
the initial payment is received. Upon full payment, the client owns the final
deliverables, while voix retains rights to pre-existing tools, templates, and
know-how. Liability is limited to the amount paid for the services, and the
agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Moldova, with venue in the
courts of Chisinau; where applicable, European law may also apply.
