# Studio Guide

Voix exists to give your work a clear, confident voice. We build portfolio
sites that feel personal, publish fast, and never require software licenses.

## What you need to start

- A short summary of what you do and who you help
- 2-5 projects or case studies with outcomes
- Brand references you like (sites, colors, or type)
- A contact method you want clients to use

## What we deliver

- A polished portfolio site with your story at the center
- Clean structure for future updates
- Publishing on GitHub Pages or your custom domain
- An annual care plan for maintenance and updates

## The intake checklist

Use this before kickoff so we can move quickly:

1. A one-paragraph bio
2. Your best 3-5 images per project
3. Testimonials or proof points
4. Your preferred call to action

## How updates work

Small edits, new projects, and maintenance fixes are covered in the annual
care plan. Larger redesigns are scoped separately.
