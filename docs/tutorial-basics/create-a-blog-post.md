# Write a case study

Case studies are your proof. We use a simple structure that reads fast and
still feels human.

## Recommended format

1. The challenge
2. Your approach
3. What changed
4. The metric or proof point

## Keep it tight

Aim for 300-600 words per project. Add one pull quote or highlight if you
have a client testimonial.
