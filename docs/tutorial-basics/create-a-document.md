# Capture your voice

Before design, we define the story. The strongest portfolios use a clear
narrative structure and repeat it across sections.

## The voice ladder

Start with a single sentence, then expand:

1. One-line promise: who you help and the outcome you deliver
2. Proof line: a metric, testimonial, or credible signal
3. Story line: a short line about how you work

## Core sections we use

- Hero statement
- Selected work
- Capabilities
- About and values
- Contact call to action

## Your content kit

Bring this to kickoff and we can build fast:

- 3-5 project summaries
- 2-3 results per project
- A list of tools you are known for
