# Make your copy scannable

Clear writing helps your voice land faster. These patterns keep pages easy to
read without losing personality.

## Use short sections

Break long paragraphs into quick blocks:

- One idea per paragraph
- A sentence with a metric
- A sentence that signals your approach

## Highlight proof points

```md

```

3. Launch
4. Maintain
```
