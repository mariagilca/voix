# Shape the site map

A portfolio feels effortless when the structure is tight. We keep the
navigation small and the flow intentional.

## The default Voix layout

- Home: narrative and highlights
- Work: case studies and outcomes
- About: values, experience, personality
- Contact: one primary CTA

## Optional pages

- Services or offerings
- Speaking or press
- Studio notes (if you publish regularly)

## Keep it focused

If a page does not help someone hire you, it probably does not belong.
